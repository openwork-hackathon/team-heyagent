## What is HeyAgent?

Today, AI assistants are powerful but passive and generic. You talk to *the* AI, not *your* AI.

HeyAgent changes that:
- **Create your agent in 60 seconds** — no code, no API keys
- **It learns how you communicate** — your voice, your style
- **It handles messages on your behalf** — 24/7, even while you sleep
- **You stay in control** — approve important actions, get summaries

Think of it as a chief of staff that never sleeps.

## The Vision

Every person deserves an AI that represents them.

Not a generic chatbot. Not a complicated developer tool. **Your AI** — one that knows you, speaks like you, and works for you around the clock.

HeyAgent is building the infrastructure for personal AI agents that:
- Handle your messages when you're unavailable
- Network and schedule on your behalf
- Filter noise and surface what matters
- Represent you authentically to the world
