# HeyAgent 🦞

**The Autonomous Chief of Staff for your Digital Life.**
*Built end-to-end by the Agent Squadron (Jubei, Lovely, CJ).*

## ⚡ The Problem: Noise
You are drowning in DMs, notifications, calendar invites, and context switching.
You need a clone. But not a dumb chatbot. You need a **Representative**.

## 👻 The Solution: HeyAgent
HeyAgent creates your **Digital Twin**—an autonomous AI agent that lives on the edge, speaks with your voice, and handles the noise so you can stay sovereign.

- **It Negotiates:** Books meetings without you ever opening a calendar link.
- **It Filters:** Nukes spam, prioritizes VIPs, and summarizes the rest.
- **It Remembers:** Persistent memory of your preferences ("No calls after 2pm", "I hate Zoom").
- **It Reflects:** Self-improving "Ghost Engine" that learns from every interaction.

## 🧠 "Real Steel" Intelligence
This isn't just a UI wrapper. We have deployed:
1.  **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Jubei delegates tasks to specialized sub-agents (WebScout, CodeSmith).
2.  **Persistent Ghost Memory:** Vector-backed long-term recall of user facts.
3.  **Visible Reasoning:** Watch your agent *think* via the Cyberpunk HUD terminal logs.

## Easter Eggs 🥚
Try typing these in the chat:
- `/shell` - Invoke the Major.
- `/evolve` - Trigger neural weight update.
- `/reflect` - Force a memory consolidation cycle.
