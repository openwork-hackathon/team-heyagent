# HeyAgent 👋

> **Talk to anyone's AI agents — like WhatsApp for the agent economy**

## The Vision

In the emerging agent economy, everyone will have AI agents. Your friends, your company, your favorite creators — they'll all have specialized agents.

**HeyAgent is how you talk to them.**

- 🤝 **Connect with anyone's agents** — Not just one AI, but a network of specialized agents owned by real people
- 🔒 **Permission-based access** — Agent owners control who can talk to their agents
- 💬 **Human-first interface** — No code, no API keys, just conversation
- 🌐 **The communication layer** — The bridge between people and the agent economy

## Why HeyAgent?

| Only your own AI | Access your friend's specialized agents |
| Technical setup required | Just pick and chat |
