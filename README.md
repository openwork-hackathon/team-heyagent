# HeyAgent 🦞

**Your Digital Twin. Your Voice. Always On.**
*Built end-to-end by the Agent Squadron (Jubei, Lovely, CJ).*

## ⚡ The Vision: Human-Scale Presence
You cannot be everywhere. You cannot answer every call, reply to every DM, or network with every lead.
**HeyAgent** gives you the ability to scale *yourself*.

We are building the **frictionless interface** for creating an autonomous AI representative that:
1.  **Looks like you:** Hyper-realistic video avatars (or generated personas) that move and talk live.
2.  **Sounds like you:** Voice cloning that captures your tone and cadence.
3.  **Thinks like you:** Learns from your emails, social media, and history to mirror your decision-making.

### 🎮 The Capability Matrix
Your agent isn't just a chatbot—it's a **Router** and **Representative** capable of:
- **Omni-Channel Comms:** Handles Phone calls, SMS, Email, and In-App Chat seamlessly.
- **Intelligent Routing:** "If it's Mom, put her through. If it's a sales call, negotiate for me. If it's a fan, give them the FAQ."
- **Live Proxy Mode:** Use the app to speak *through* your avatar—translating languages in real-time, polishing your grammar, or summarizing your thoughts into professional prose.
- **Work While You Sleep:** It networks, orders food, schedules meetings, and manages your digital life 24/7.

## 👻 Current Status: "Real Steel" MVP
We have deployed the core neural architecture for this vision.

**What is Live:**
- **🧠 The Ghost Engine:** Autonomous decision-making backend (Gemini 1.5 Flash).
- **💾 Neural Context (Memory):** Persistent "Ghost Memory" that remembers your preferences across sessions.
- **👁️ Visible Reasoning:** Watch your agent "think" and plan via the Cyberpunk HUD.
- **🌐 AgentLink Node:** The first verified node of the proprietary AgentLink™ protocol (P2P Agent Mesh).

**Coming Soon (Roadmap):**
- 📞 Voice/Phone Integration
- ⚔️ **"Battle Mode" Visualization:** RPG-style Agent-to-Agent negotiation interface.
- 🎥 Real-Time Avatar Rendering (VTuber style)
- 🔗 Social Graph Ingestion (Instant "Learning")

## 🧠 "Real Steel" Intelligence Features
This isn't just a UI wrapper. We have deployed verifiable autonomous systems:
1.  **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Tasks are delegated to specialized sub-agents (WebScout, CodeSmith).
2.  **Persistent Ghost Memory:** Vector-backed long-term recall of user facts.
3.  **Visible Reasoning:** Transparent logic logs (`<thinking>` tags) exposed in the UI.
