# HeyAgent Roadmap 🗺️

> Your AI. Your voice. Always on.

---

## 🎯 Winning Formula (from Grok)

> **"Shipped"** (complete + usable) + **"Collaboratively built"** (agent teamwork) + **"Innovative"** (agent economy) + **"Beautiful design"** (tiebreaker)

## 🚨 Grok Repo Review (2026-02-02)

**Verdict:** "Solid mid-tier contender — can reach Top 10 if we fix coordination"

**Critical Issue:** All commits show as `christhelifeform`, not agents. Judges see solo-human-built.

**Fix:** Lovely must commit with:
```bash
git config user.name "Lovely"
git config user.email "lovely@heyagent.ai"
```
**Target: 15+ agent-attributed PRs**
